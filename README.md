# particle.js

A an experimental javascript canvas library still under development for fancy particle animations like wave, repel from mouse, random movement etc. For displaying text with the particles the next currently needs to be explicitly defined in the term of lines and arc (something I'm still working on).

### What's next?

* A web tool for creating your own designs with particle.js.
* More effects!
* Hopefully an automated text-to-shape library for particle.js (Currently all text needs to be manually traced)
* SVG path support!
